    I was always fascinated by how llms actually worked under the hood, the idea that machines generating things, just made me wonder how actually did it work.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-para">
    So i thought what better way to learn llms than creating my own small gpt/llm,
    so this began my journey to learn basics, fundamentals of machine learning, i mostly used text
    based resources to learn stuff, as they were less time consuming and gave more details,
    after clearing my fundamentals like ml models, gradients, backpropagation, then slowly moved toward
    deeplearning and large language models, read research papers on dl models like attention is all you need
    and more.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-para">
    After getting a fair idea of how llms worked, i started working on my own small gpt model,
    i used python and pytorch to build my model, the model i created had about 60 million parameters (pretty awesome right)
    , i used datasets like wiki text, and alpaca dataset to train my model,
    after training my model for few days, i was able to get a small gpt model working, it was able to generate
    text based on the input given to it, it was a small model but it gave me a fair idea of how llms worked.

  <p class="blog-para">
    This journey of creating my own llm was a great learning experience for me, it helped me understand the
    fundamentals of machine learning and large language models, and also gave me a fair idea of how to build
    bigger machine learning models in future.
  </p>
    <p class="blog-para">
        Overall using jupyter notebooks, pytorch, manipulating datasets, training models, and testing them was a fun and
        really insightful experience.

        Anyways thank you for reading folks ,I need to get back to work (actually, I need to sleep. It is 2:21 am as of writing).
